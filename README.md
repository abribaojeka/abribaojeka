Hi I am @abribaojeka, a software engineer and have been in the software industry for about fifteen years, with project work experience in:
1. Enterprise systems development 
2. Document management system
3. School management system
4. Medical records management system

I am interested in exploring into projects and collaborating with like minds to engineer software machines for varying real world problems. 
I am open to learning and willing to share from experiences.
I am currently exploring the python development platform with particular interest in Django python framework. I think I have made quite a lot of progress.
I am a full stack developer(both front and backend) with the use of HTML, Javascripts, php, and django. 
I have build a formidable capacity for adaptability and amenability with design and development skills. 
I will be glad to work with any team here and on any project.

Am new here on github and hope to build repositry with time.
